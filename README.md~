# LaxDataCollector

### Overview
This is an Android application developed for the LaxBit, a data collection and identification project targeting the sport of lacrosse. The purpose of this application is to communicate over a BluetoothLowEnergy connection to a set of gyroscope accerlerometers, and retrieve position/rotation data. The information can then be stored locally or relayed via email to the user for further processing. 

### Requirements and Installation
The only requirements to compile this application are the Android SDK, the Java JDK, and the AndroidStudio IDE. 

Installation of this repository is not required. Simply opening the cloned repository in AndroidStudio is sufficient to modify and execute the code. 

### Running the Application
To run the application you must build and upload the project from the AndroidStudio IDE to a connected and compatible Android device. This is as simple as connecting your device to your workstation via USB, selecting it from the Android Device Manager drop-down, and hitting shift-F10.

This will install the application on your device and automatically launch the program.
